1) ask the user what their name is
2) you need to store their name in a variable
3) Generate a random number between 1 and 10, and store that in a variable
4) Then the console will ask the user what number they are thinking of, between 1 and 10
5) Then allow the user to input a guess until they get the answer right
6) Once the user correctly answers the question, give them ascii art and results from ze test! 
7) Ask them if they would like to play again, if not then exit the program


notes: look on stackex for node. js has a built in math library for generating random numbers
google ascii art. fizzbuzz. need to write a loop between 4 and 5. define a function for the beginning of the program. javascript kit.
